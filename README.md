## Single .m4b Audiobook Script

iTunes and the iOS books app prefer audiobooks as a single m4b file. Unfortunately, many audiobooks comes as multiple mp3 files. This program takes a directory filled with mp3 files and creates a single m4b file out of them

This is a personal project made for utility.
